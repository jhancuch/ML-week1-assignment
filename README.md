# EDA for Kaggle Housing Prices Dataset

## Intro
The purpose of this repository is to conduct exploritory data analysis (EDA) on the "Housing Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset found on kaggle ([dataset link](httpswww.sec.govfilesforms-3-4-5.pdf)). The following paragraphs covers analysis and insights generated by examining:
* Distribution of the dependent variable
* Missing data and outliers
* Potential predictors of the dependent variable
* Feature creation by splitting, merging, or otherwise generating a new predictor
* Min-max and standard scaling including the dependent variable

## Distribution of the dependent variable
First, using a histogram of the dependent variable values to visually represent the distribution, we can see SalePrice has a long right-hand tail. This means the variable as a positive skew and we see this in the statistic computed with the value of 1.88. We can also note the skewness from the difference between the mean and median. The mean can be heavily influenced by outliers and we see that the mean SalePrice is $180,921 while the median is $163,000 indicating outliers on the right-hand of the distribution. 
In Ames, Iowa, it appears that the median house for $163,000 but the top 25% of sales sell for $214,000 or higher with a max of $755,000. With a standard deviation of $79,442, the top quartile contains observations outside of the 3 standard deviation rule indicating we may have outliers.
